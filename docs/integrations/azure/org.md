description: Importing users and groups from a Microsoft Azure Active Directory into Backstage
---

The Backstage catalog can be set up to ingest organizational data - users and
teams - directly from a tenant in Microsoft Azure Active Directory via the
Microsoft Graph API.

More details on this are available in the
[README of the `@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend-module-msgraph` package](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/plugins/catalog-backend-module-msgraph/README.md).
