## The Backstage Roadmap

Backstage is currently under rapid development. This page details the project‚Äôs
public roadmap, the result of ongoing collaboration between the core maintainers
and the broader Backstage community.

The Backstage roadmap lays out both [‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next‚Äù](#whats-next) and
[‚Äúfuture work‚Äù](#future-work). With "next" we mean features planned for release
within the ongoing quarter from January through March 2022. With "future" we
mean features in the radar, but not yet scheduled.

The long-term roadmap (12 - 36 months) is not detailed in the public roadmap.
Third-party contributions are also not currently included in the roadmap. Let us
know about any ongoing developments and we‚Äôre happy to include them here as well.

## What‚Äôs next

The feature set below is planned for the ongoing quarter, and grouped by theme.
The list order doesn‚Äôt necessarily reflect priority, and the development/release
cycle will vary based on maintainer schedules.

### Backstage 1.0 (and following versions)

During the first quarter of 2022, we plan to finalize and release version 1.0 of
the Backstage platform (which includes Core,
[Catalog](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/software-catalog-overview),
[Scaffolder](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/software-templates-index)
and [TechDocs](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/techdocs-overview)).
Included as part of this milestone:

- Deciding on the cadence of minor/weekly/daily releases to provide clarity on
  the frequency and expectations for future versions of the platform and its
  defining modules.
- Establish the support model to set the expectations from the adopters in their
  respective use cases.

### Backstage Security Audit

This initiative is the first of a broader Security Strategy for Backstage. The
purpose of the Security Audit is to involve third-party companies in auditing
the platform and highlighting potential vulnerabilities. The benefit for the
adopters is clear: We want Backstage to be as secure as possible, and we want to
make it reliable through a specific initiative. This initiative in particular is
done together, and with the support of, the
[Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/).

### Moving to Incubation in CNCF

The progress of the request can be seen
[here](https://github.com/cncf/toc/pull/717).

## Future work

The following feature list doesn‚Äôt represent a commitment to develop, and the
list order doesn‚Äôt reflect any priority or importance, but these features are on
the maintainers‚Äô radar, with clear interest expressed by the community.

- **Backend Services:** To better scale and maintain the Backstage instances, a
  backend layer of services is planned to be introduced as part of the software
  architecture. This layer of backend services will help in decoupling the
  various modules (e.g. Catalog and Scaffolder) from the frontend experience.
- **Security Plan (and Strategy):** The purpose of the Security Strategy is to
  move another step along the path to maturing the platform, setting the
  expectations of any adopters from a security standpoint.
- **Search 1.0:** Fix the few remaining issues to get Backstage Search platform
  up to 1.0 ([here](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/milestone/27) and
  [here](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/milestone/28)).
- **TechDocs Addon framework and Addons:** Addons are TechDocs features that are
  added on top of the base docs like code experience. An example would be a
  feature that showed comments on the page. We plan to add an Addon framework
  and open source a selection of the Addons that we use internally at Spotify.
  Further Addons can then be added by the Community.
- **Composable Homepage 1.0:** Driving this to 1.0 by adding some composable
  components.
- **[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) support:** Introduce the ability to query
  Backstage backend services with a standard query language for APIs.
- **Telemetry:** To efficiently generate logging and metrics in such a way that
  adopters can get insights so that Backstage can be monitored and improved.
- **Improved UX design:** Provide a better Backstage user experience through
  visual guidelines and templates, especially navigation across plug-ins and
  portal functionalities.

## How to influence the roadmap

As we evolve Backstage, we want you to contribute actively in the journey to
define the most effective developer experience in the world.

A roadmap is only useful if it captures real needs. If you have success stories,
feedback, or ideas, we want to hear from you! If you plan to work (or are
already working) on a new or existing feature, please let us know, so that we
can update the roadmap accordingly. We are also happy to share knowledge and
context that will help your feature land successfully.

You can also head over to the
[CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
guidelines to get started.

If you have specific questions about the roadmap, please create an
[issue](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/new/choose), ping us on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/qxsEfa8Vq8), or
[book time](http://calendly.com/spotify-backstage) with the Spotify team.
