## npm

npm packages are published through CI/CD in the
[`.github/workflows/deploy_packages.yml`](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/.github/workflows/deploy_packages.yml)
workflow. Every commit that is merged to master will be checked for new versions
of all public packages, and any new versions will automatically be published to
npm.

### Creating a new release

Releases are handled by changesets and trigger whenever the "Version Packages"
PR is merged. This is typically done every Thursday around noon CET.

## Emergency Release Process

**This emergency release process is intended only for the Backstage
maintainers.**

For this example we will be using the `@backstage/plugin-foo` package as an
example and assume that it is currently version `6.5.0` in the master branch.

In the event of a severe bug being introduced in version `6.5.0` of the
`@backstage/plugin-foo` released in the `v1.18.0` Backstage release, the following
process is used to release an emergency fix as version `6.5.1` in the patch release `v1.18.1`:

- [ ] Identify the release or releases that need to be patched. We should always
      patch the most recent major or minor main-line release if needed, which in this example
      would be `v1.18.0`. The fix may also need backporting to older major
      versions, in which case we will want to patch the main-line release just
      before the one that bumped the package to each new major version.
- [ ] Repeat the following steps for each release that needs to be patched:

  - [ ] Make sure a patch branch exists for the release that is being patched.
        If a patch already exists, reuse the existing branch. The branch **must
        always** be named exactly `patch/<release>`.

    ```bash
    git checkout v1.18.0
    git checkout -b patch/v1.18.0
    git push --set-upstream origin patch/v1.18.0
    ```

  - [ ] With the `patch/v1.18.0` branch as a base, create a new
        branch for your fix. This branch can be named anything, but the
        following naming pattern may be suitable:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b ${USER}/plugin-foo-v1.18.0-fix
    ```

  - [ ] Create a single commit that applies fix, nothing else.
  - [ ] Create a changeset for the affected package(s), then run `yarn release` in the root
        of the repo in order to convert your changeset into package version bumps and changelog entries.
        Commit these changes as a second `"Generated release"` commit.
  - [ ] Create PR towards the base branch (`patch/v1.18.0`) containing the two commits.
  - [ ] Review/Merge the PR into `patch/v1.18.0`. This will automatically trigger a release.

- [ ] Look up the new version of our package in the patch PR as well as the new release
      version, these can be found in the package `package.json` and the root `package.json`, and
      will in this case be `6.5.1` and `v1.18.1`. You will need these versions later.
- [ ] Make sure you have the latest versions of the patch branch fetched, after merging the PR: `git fetch`.
- [ ] Once fixes have been created for each release, the fix should be applied to the
      master branch as well. Create a PR that contains the following:

  - [ ] The fix, which you can likely cherry-pick from your patch branch: `git cherry-pick origin/patch/v1.18.0^`
  - [ ] An updated `CHANGELOG.md` of all patched packages from the tip of the patch branch, `git checkout origin/patch/v1.18.0 -- {packages,plugins}/*/CHANGELOG.md`.
  - [ ] A changeset with the message "Applied the fix from version `6.5.1` of this package, which is part of the `v1.18.1` release of Backstage."
